# JavaScript Snake
JavaScript Snake is a Snake game I programmed using Glitch and p5.js. 
  
Using the arrow keys, move a color-changing snake around the canvas and collect as many apples as possible. The apples will add to the snake's length. If the snake collides with the sides or with itself, game over.
